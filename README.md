# Project Title - Shraddha's YT Channel ðŸŽ¥ ðŸ™Œ

"Greetings,

I am pleased to present my 1st project assignment submission for INFO 6150. This project revolves around the development of my personal YouTube page, to serve as a platform for showcasing my past 2-3 months experience through videos. What makes it interesting is that I've used this project to learn the basics of web design, using HTML and CSS. I hope you enjoy exploring this page, where you'll find a mix of my adventures and my newfound web design skills taught by my favorite professor, Vishal Chawla."

### HTML Controls Used ðŸ’»âŒ¨

#### I've set up a basic layout for my YouTube page, complete with a navbar, header, footer, and content section, along with some additional elements.

#### In the content section of this webpage, implemented autoplaying videos that continuously loop for an engaging user experience. Additionally, I've made sure that my username is a clickable hyperlink, directing users to my LinkedIn profile for further networking and information

#### I've used a custom YouTube favicon in my webpage.

#### Added a clickable YouTube logo to the top-left corner of the webpage, which directs users to YouTube home page when clicked.

#### Incorporated a search bar into the webpage, with a search button on its right side of the search bar. When users click the search button, a message pops up, saying, 'You need internet access to search!!'"

#### Users can access my account information by clicking on the account icon at the top right corner. From there, they can view my profile picture, read a summary of my channel, listen to a welcome voice message, and find my contact details

#### From the homepage, users can easily navigate to the 'Home Table' section, where they'll find a table displaying detailed statistics about my YouTube channel's performance and how my videos have been received.

#### Likewise, when users click on the 'Trending' button, they'll be directed to the official YouTube Trending page

#### The final clickable link in the navbar is the 'Subscription' button. When users click it, they'll be directed to a form where they can subscribe to my YouTube channel

#### Additionally, for learning purposes, I've implemented a 'Menu' tag to serve two primary functions on my YouTube channel webpage: 'Save for Later' and 'Share this Video' options.
