"Greetings,

I am pleased to present my 1st project assignment submission for INFO 6150. This project revolves around the development of my personal YouTube page, to serve as a platform for showcasing my past 2-3 months experience through videos. What makes it interesting is that I've used this project to learn the basics of web design, using HTML and CSS. I hope you enjoy exploring this page, where you'll find a mix of my adventures and my newfound web design skills taught by my favorite professor, Vishal Chawla."

### Project Title

I have utilized a comprehensive set of HTML and HTML5 controls in my project, including:

1. Favicon for a customized icon.
2. Table for organized data presentation.
3. Form to collect user input.
4. Images to enhance visual content.
5. Hyperlinks for seamless navigation.
6. Buttons to trigger actions.
7. Audio for sound integration.
8. Video for multimedia content.
9. Header for top-level page content.
10. Footer to wrap up the page.
11. Summary for concise content.
12. Menu for easy navigation.
13. `tel` for contact information with a phone number link.
14. `mailto` for contact information with an email link.

Furthermore, I've adhered to the requirement of using an external CSS file for styling, ensuring a clean separation of content and presentation in accordance with best practices.
