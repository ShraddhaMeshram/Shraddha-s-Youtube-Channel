# Project Title - Shraddha's YT Channel

"Greetings,

I am pleased to present my 1st project assignment submission for INFO 6150. This project revolves around the development of my personal YouTube page, to serve as a platform for showcasing my past 2-3 months experience through videos. What makes it interesting is that I've used this project to learn the basics of web design, using HTML and CSS. I hope you enjoy exploring this page, where you'll find a mix of my adventures and my newfound web design skills."
